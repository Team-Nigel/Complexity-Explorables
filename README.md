# Complexity Explorable Template

This complexity explorable template is adapted from a [Complexity Explorable](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/) produced by [Dirk Brockmann](https://github.com/dirkbrockmann/complexity_explorable_orlis_flocknroll). The content here was used to learn the layout and syntax of such explorables in order to serve as a template basis for producing similar animated simulations. It was based on the [**Orli's Flock'n Roll**](http://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/orlis-flockn-roll/) simulation.
